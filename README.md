# Budget-Combat

## Overview
Budget Combat is a 2D resource management and combat game. There are 3 total levels, and each level will get increasingly difficult as you progress. Fortunately, your budget and available arsenal will grow as well. Good luck!

## Controls

- **Doors**: Press the space key to kick down doors (or enemies).
- **Attempts/Deaths**: After each death, click "Restart" to go back to the budgeting screen and play again, or click "Main Menu" to return to the level selector.
